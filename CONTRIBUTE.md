- **Python 3.8+**: Ensure Python is installed ([download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).
- **Git**: For version control ([install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)).
- **pip**: Python package manager (comes with Python).
- A GitHub account to submit Pull Requests.

### Setting Up Your Development Environment
1. **Fork the Repository**:
   - Go to [github.com/Diramid/hey-403-cli](https://github.com/Diramid/hey-403-cli) and click "Fork".
   - Clone your fork:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/hey-403-cli.git
     cd hey-403-cli
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install the project in editable mode with development dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -e .[dev]
     ```
   - This installs `rich`, `requests`, `dnspython`, `pytest`, and other dev tools.

3. **Verify Setup**:
   - Run the existing tests to ensure everything works:
     ```bash
     pytest tests/ -v
     ```

## How to Contribute

### Finding Something to Work On
- Check the [ROADMAP](https://github.com/Diramid/hey403/issues/13) for planned features and tasks.
- Browse open [issues](https://github.com/Diramid/hey-403-cli/issues) labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`.
- Propose a new feature or bug fix by opening an issue to discuss it first.

### Making Changes
1. **Create a Branch**:
   - Use a descriptive branch name, e.g., `feature/add-json-output` or `fix/dns-timeout`:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
     ```

2. **Write Your Code**:
   - Follow the **Code Style Guidelines** below.
   - Add or update tests in the `tests/` directory for your changes.
   - Update documentation (e.g., `README.md` or docstrings) if needed.

3. **Test Your Changes**:
   - Run the test suite:
     ```bash
     pytest tests/ -v
     ```
   - Ensure all tests pass and aim for >80% test coverage (use `pytest-cov` for coverage reports).
   - Manually test your changes with:
     ```bash
     hey403 example.com
     ```

4. **Commit Your Changes**:
   - Write clear, concise commit messages (e.g., `Add JSON output support for test results`).
   - Use:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
     ```

5. **Push and Create a Pull Request**:
   - Push your branch to your fork:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature/your-feature-name
     ```
   - Open a Pull Request (PR) on the [main repository](https://github.com/Diramid/hey-403-cli).
   - In the PR description, explain:
     - What the change does.
     - Why itâ€™s needed (link to relevant issue if applicable).
     - How you tested it.

## Code Style Guidelines
To keep the codebase consistent:
- **Python Style**: Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) for code style. Use `flake8` to check:
  ```bash
  flake8 .
  ```
- **Formatting**: Use `black` for automatic code formatting:
  ```bash
  black .
  ```
- **Docstrings**: Write clear docstrings for functions and modules using Google style (see [example](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)).
- **Type Hints**: Use type annotations where possible (checked with `mypy`).
- **Commit Messages**: Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (e.g., `feat: add JSON output`, `fix: handle DNS timeout errors`).
- **Dependencies**: Avoid adding new dependencies unless necessary. Discuss in an issue first.
